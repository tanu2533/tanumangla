Summary:

The admission management database collects and organizes data related to students, departments, assignments, courses, and admissions processes within an educational institution. It maintains information on students' personal details, academic records, departmental affiliations, assigned tasks, enrolled courses, and admission statuses.

Students: The database stores comprehensive information about students, including their names, contact details, academic history, and enrollment status. This data enables administrators to manage student records efficiently and track their progress throughout their academic journey.

Departments: Details about various academic departments, such as their names, faculty members, and specializations, are stored in the database. This facilitates the organization and administration of departmental activities, including course scheduling, faculty assignments, and resource allocation.

Assignments: Information regarding assignments, projects, or tasks assigned to students is recorded in the database. This includes details such as assignment titles, deadlines, instructions, and evaluation criteria. Tracking assignments helps educators monitor student performance and assess their learning outcomes effectively.

Courses: The database contains comprehensive data about the courses offered by the institution, including course codes, titles, descriptions, prerequisites, and schedules. This information assists students in selecting appropriate courses based on their academic goals and requirements.
